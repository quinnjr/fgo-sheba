# FGO Sheba

> AI-powered Fate/Grand Order automation for Android

FGO Sheba is an Android application that automates Fate/Grand Order battles using machine learning. It features an AI battle engine for intelligent card selection and Noble Phantasm timing, an ONNX-based vision system for real-time game state detection, and a stealth layer that simulates human behavior to avoid detection. The app is built with a Rust core library bridged to a Kotlin Android frontend via JNI, and supports 17 languages.
